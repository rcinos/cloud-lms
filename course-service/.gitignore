# Database migration files (except initial script, if managed by Flask-Migrate)
# Flask-Migrate generates version scripts, which ARE usually committed.
# However, if you have specific temporary migration files or local databases, ignore them.
# The `migrations/versions/` directory should typically be committed.
# Only ignore if you explicitly don't want local migration artifacts to be tracked.
# For example, if you have a local test DB file:
*.db

# Docker specific (if build context includes files you don't want in the final image)
# Often, everything inside the project directory is meant for the Docker image.
# If you have specific files like build artifacts *outside* /app that are transient, add them.
# Example: Docker build context cache
.dockerignore # This file should be committed
